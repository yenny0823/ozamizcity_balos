                    <p>
                        Ozamiz City was originally known as "Ozamiz," derived from the local term "Ozamiz," which means "to gather." The city has a storied past, having been established during the Spanish colonial period. It was officially founded in 1756 and became a significant trading post due to its strategic location along the coast.
