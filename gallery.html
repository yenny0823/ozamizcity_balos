            <p>The miraculous statue of the Birhen sa Cotta was brought to the City in the 1700s and was originally housed in the Cotta Fort and then transferred to the Immaculate Concepcion Church. The image mysteriously disappeared in the 1970s. In 2016, it was found in Manila by an antique collector and was returned to Ozamiz on December 8, 2017, the feast day celebration of the Birhen sa Cotta, in an emotional homecoming attended by thousands of pilgrims. The Birhen sa Cotta remains one of the most visited religious sites of the faithful in Mindanao.</p>
